# Deployment Guide for Pilates App

## Issue: Upload Works on Localhost but Not on Vercel

The upload function uses a backend server. You have two options:

## Option 1: Deploy Server to Vercel or Railway (Recommended)

### Deploy Backend to Vercel

1. **Create a new Vercel project for the server:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Create a new project
   - Connect the `server` folder (or create a separate repo for it)

2. **Set up environment variables in Vercel:**
   - Go to Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add these variables:
     ```
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dvppsykcl
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=648435193157952
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=CbYhHeRIZF-Zj0StW-MJprWzgQg
     ```

3. **Create a `.vercelignore` in the server folder:**
   ```
   uploads/
   .env
   ```

4. **Get your server URL:**
   - After deployment, Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

5. **Update frontend environment variable:**
   - In your frontend Vercel project, go to Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add: `VITE_UPLOAD_API_URL=https://your-server-app.vercel.app/upload`

### Deploy Backend to Railway (Alternative)

Railway is easier for Node.js backends:

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. New Project > Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Select your server directory
4. Add environment variables (same as above)
5. Get the deployment URL
6. Update `VITE_UPLOAD_API_URL` in frontend Vercel settings

## Option 2: Upload Directly from Client to Cloudinary (Simpler, No Backend Needed)

If you don't want to deploy a backend server, you can upload directly from the client to Cloudinary:

### Steps:

1. **Create a new file:** `client/src/utils/cloudinaryUpload.js`
   ```javascript
   export const uploadToCloudinary = async (file) => {
     const formData = new FormData();
     formData.append('file', file);
     formData.append('upload_preset', 'your_upload_preset'); // Create this in Cloudinary
     formData.append('folder', 'pilates-uploads');

     const response = await fetch(
       `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/dvppsykcl/image/upload`,
       {
         method: 'POST',
         body: formData,
       }
     );

     const data = await response.json();
     return data.secure_url;
   };
   ```

2. **In Cloudinary Dashboard:**
   - Go to Settings > Upload
   - Create an "Upload Preset"
   - Set it to "Unsigned" (no authentication needed)
   - Copy the preset name

3. **Update Adminpanel.jsx to use direct upload:**
   ```javascript
   import { uploadToCloudinary } from '../utils/cloudinaryUpload';
   
   const handleUpload = async () => {
     // ... validation code ...
     
     try {
       const imageUrl = await uploadToCloudinary(selectedImage);
       setUploadedImageUrl(imageUrl);
       setEditData({ ...editData, imageUrl });
       alert("Image uploaded successfully!");
     } catch (error) {
       alert("Upload failed!");
     }
   };
   ```

## Recommendation

**Option 2 (Direct Cloudinary Upload)** is simpler and faster:
- ✅ No backend server needed
- ✅ One less thing to deploy
- ✅ Cheaper (no server costs)
- ✅ Works immediately

The only downside is your Cloudinary API secret is exposed (but with unsigned uploads, it's the intended way).

## Current Setup

Your code now uses `import.meta.env.VITE_UPLOAD_API_URL` which defaults to `http://localhost:5000` for local development.

For production on Vercel, set the `VITE_UPLOAD_API_URL` environment variable to point to your deployed server URL.
